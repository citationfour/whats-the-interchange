# What's The Interchange?

## A Small Project By @elfryt

### Originally "Is this a real interchange?", it was changed to be simpler, and easier, and less confusing (to make and to play).

### How to Beta Test with us:
#### Just add an Issue with GitHub! I check them almost everyday if not every week. Alternatively, join my development discord channel, Webllow Designs! https://discord.gg/WcHhxR7QhQ

## Version v.1b
### New additions
### - More Images and Questions
### - Slightly Tweaked System
### - End Screen
### - Bug Fixes

## Report any bugs to GitHub issues! 
## Got suggestions? Put it in my Discord server!
